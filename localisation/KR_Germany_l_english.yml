### Temporary ###
GER_poli_temp:0 "Final Reforms"
GER_poli_temp_desc:0 "For too long people have battled over where power should lie in our great government. It is time to answer that question once and for all."

### Ideas ###
black_guarantee:0 "Guaranteed Private Holdings"
black_guarantee_desc:0 "By guaranteeing the bank deposits of private citizens we have managed to stave off some level of panic. The cost has been immense however."

GER_political_uncertainty:0 "Political Uncertainty"
GER_political_uncertainty_desc:0 "Ludendorff's dictatorship exposed several serious problems in our government. Despite this, little has changed in the Constitution since 1871. It has yet to be seen if the increasingly loud calls for reform will be answered, ignored, or silenced."

GER_imperial_pride:0 "Imperial Pride"
GER_imperial_pride_desc:0 "The German Empire rests at the very top of the world's pecking order, a place it has enjoyed since the end of the Weltkrieg. It would take a great deal for them to admit defeat in the coming war... Though there are some who suggest that Germany's resilience is more brittle than it appears. Should the unthinkable happen and Berlin falls, or Germany loses control of many of its major cities, the nation would likely capitulate long before most of its territory is actually occupied."
GER_ready_to_surrender:0 "Submission"

GER_black_monday:0 "Black Monday Effects"
GER_black_monday_desc:0 "The stock market in Berlin has collapsed, and with it, Germany's already stagnant economy. If Germany is to retain its hegemonic position, the 'Black Monday' crisis must be addressed."

GER_black_monday1:0 "Schachtplan"
GER_black_monday1_desc:0 "Hjalmer Schacht, president of the German state bank, has implemented a controversial economic stimulus programme. His efforts seem to have succeeded in at least partially alleviating the Black Monday crisis, and public markets have already begun to slowly trend upwards."

GER_black_monday2:0 "Grönerplan"
GER_black_monday2_desc:0 "Statesman Wilhelm Gröner's proposal to allow conscripts to fulfil a year of military service through labour has been implemented, and the Black Monday crisis has been partially resolved by the extra employment boost."

GER_address_reichstag:0 "Address the Reichstag"
GER_address_reichstag_desc:0 "While we've implemented the preliminary steps to solve the Black Monday crisis, the situation is still dire. Despite his senility and failing health, Kaiser Wilhelm II has expressed in an address to the Reichstag that their first priority must be fixing the economy as soon as possible. Which proposals will be accepted, however, has yet to be seen..."

german_eco_finished:0 "Economic Resurgance"
german_eco_finished_desc:0 "Our economy has received fresh incentives and again liquidity has begun to flow. While it will not hold forever, for a time we should have something of a boom on our hands."

GER_rhine_unrest:0 "Rhineland Workers' Strike"

GER_col:0 "Colonial Upkeep"

GER_mil_mis:0 "German Military Mission"

GER_quenched_militarism:0 "Quenched Militarism"
GER_quenched_militarism_desc:0 "Victory always comes at a cost, and the Weltkrieg was unlike any war the world had ever seen. While we may have been victorious, that didn't bring our boys home. Our families still remember that pain clearly and are not eager to experience it again."

GER_quenched_militarism2:0 "Quenched Militarism"
GER_quenched_militarism2_desc:0 "Victory always comes at a cost, and the Weltkrieg was unlike any war the world had ever seen. While we may have been victorious, that didn't bring our boys home. Our families still remember that pain clearly and are not eager to experience it again. Though we've increased our recruitment, many of the youth are unwilling and unready for a true war."

GER_renwed_militarism:0 "Renewed Militarism"
GER_renwed_militarism_desc:0 "Though the German race has always been martial, the price we paid in blood during the Weltkrieg and the wars thereafter has been extortionate. Despite this, there is no more room for complacency. German patriotism is a virtue and the people will remember that fact."

GER_research_boost:0 "Research Funding"
GER_research_boost_desc:0 "The only way that we can get scientists out of their lecture halls and into the laboratories is by throwing money at them. Increased state funding will go some way to helping with this."

GER_victors_of_wwi:0 "Victors of the Weltkrieg"
GER_victors_of_wwi_desc:0 "We were the undisputed victors of the Weltkrieg and our place in the sun all but guaranteed. Unfortunately that was 20 years ago and our arrogance may have got the better of us since then..."

GER_tank_idea:0 "Investment in Panzers"
GER_tank_idea_desc:0 "Some view the Panzer as the weapon with which all future wars will be decided. Further investment into the area is vital for German hegemony to continue."

GER_tirpitz_ideda:0 "Tirpitzprogramm"
GER_tirpitz_idea_desc:0 "Großadmiral Tirpitz was the titan of his age, and his investment into the Kaiserliche Marine prior to the Weltkrieg ensured that we had a fleet capable of facing off against the Royal Navy. Such vision is needed again."

GER_junkers_lost_idea:0 "Problems with Grain Supply"
GER_junkers_lost_idea_desc:0 "With Germany's population expanding after the Weltkrieg and during the Tirpitz golden age, we became reliant on grain from our Mitteleuropan partners. With there now being a hole in our eastern buffer, food supplies have dropped."

GER_easter_promises_idea:0 "Easter Promises"
GER_easter_promises_idea_desc:0 "When Germany was at its nadir after the Turnip Winter of 1916-1917, the Kaiser promised constitutional reform after the Weltkrieg ended. Perhaps now, with our stagnancy becoming increasingly evident, things might change."

GER_bundesrat_idea:0 "Restored Bundesrat"
GER_bundesrat_idea_desc:0 "The Ludendorff regime rode roughshod over many of the privileges that the German states had prior to the Weltkrieg, one of them being representation in the form of the Bundesrat. Restoring this ancient right is a great sign of things to come."

GER_post_idea:0 "German Post Office"
GER_post_idea_desc:0 "Though it may seem laughable, one of the last bulwarks against complete federal integration under the Reich was the existence of separate postal services. With this rectified, Germany truly is united."

GER_embrace_FAUD_idea:0 "Freie Arbeiterunion Deutschlands"
GER_embrace_FAUD_idea_desc:0 "The best way to disarm the Syndicalist menace is by working with less ideological leftists. Tolerating the main trade union should give less succour to the Reds in Germany."

GER_dcgb_idea:0 "Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund"
GER_dcgb_idea_desc:0 "A new state-sponsored union can channel the energies of our working class in the right direction."

GER_two_front_idea:0 "War on Two Fronts"
GER_two-front_idea_desc:0 "We're at war with both France and Russia, a nightmarish situation that we strove to avoid at all costs. We won once, and we shall do so again!"

AUS_Integration:0 "Austrian Integration"
AUS_Integration_desc:0 "Austrian integration will take time. Until it is finished we won't be the unified fighting force we should be."

GER_FVP1:0 "The Fourty Hour Work Week"
GER_FVP1_desc:0 "The implementation of the fourty hour work week has created a situation where employers can no longer expect to succeed by making their workers labor endlessly. The result of this new regulation has been a race of innovation and productivity, one that we can capitalize on and benefit from by increasing infrastructure investments in parallel."

GER_NLP2:0 "Easy Money Policy"
GER_NLP2_desc:0 "Simple and low-risk access to credit for both the general populace and businesses is causing some economic growth within the private sector."

GER_DKP2:0 "Agricultural Subsidies"
GER_DKP2_desc:0 "Subsidising agriculture both makes farmers fond of our administration and increases food supply. What's not to love?"

GER_ZEN2:0 "The Shakeout"
GER_ZEN2_desc:0 "Businesses are closing and consolidating together in the aftermath of Black Monday, causing some short-term chaos."

GER_ZEN1:0 "German Austerity"
GER_ZEN1_desc:0 "Waste not, want not. By cutting down on government expenditures wherever we can and securing budgetary confidence, our stability even in the face of crisis is guaranteed."

GER_ZEN22:0 "Consolidated Industry"
GER_ZEN22_desc:0 "Following Brüning's program of allowing German industry to settle with minimal intervention, it seems as though efficiency and output has increased as a result."

### Decisions ###
GER_send_support_to_bulgaria:0 "Send Support to Bulgaria"
GER_send_support_to_bulgaria:0 "While they may not have been a game-changer, Bulgaria was still our loyal ally during the Weltkrieg, and they are not at risk from the Serbian invasion. [Root.GetNameDefCap] does not forget its friends, and we shall move to help the Tsar at once!"

french_occupation_decisions:0 "The French Occupation"
french_occupation_decisions_desc:0 "Resistance is ongoing within the territory of [FRA.GetNameDef]. Short of defeating the entirety of the Third Internationale, it might be possible to erode the legitimacy of the Communard government-in-exile to the point that resistance forces in France surrender completely.\n\nThe current §YLegitimacy§! of [FRA.GetNameDef]: §R[?FRA.legitimacy|-0]§!\n"
GER_erode_cof_legitimacy:0 "Erode Communard Legitimacy"
GER_erode_cof_legitimacy_desc:0 "Our efforts must be to convince the French people that the Communard government is and always was an illegitimate construction, as well as their true oppressor. If their will to fight on behalf of the syndicalists collapses, there will be little opposition to our occupation."
GER_invite_nfa_to_france:0 "Invite [NFA.GetNameDef] Back to France"
GER_invite_nfa_to_france_desc:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has far more ability than we do to erode [FRA.GetNameDef]'s legitimacy... but only if they hold enough territory in continental France to claim some kind of victory. Currently that isn't the case. In order to expedite the progress of defeating the French resistance, perhaps it's worth considering whether we could turn over some of our occupied territory to them in the south? At the very least, it would establish some gratitude on their part."

GER_black_monday_decisions:0 "Black Monday Crisis"
GER_black_monday_tooltip:0 "The Black Monday Crisis is wreaking havoc on our economy."

GER_bm_radio:0 "The Kanzler and the Radio"
GER_bm_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the Germans' belief in their country. Public faith is key, so starting weekly radio addresses to announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis will help avoid panic and keep trust in our administration."

GER_bm_halbstarke:0 "Mitigating the Halbstarke Terror"
GER_bm_halbstarke_desc:0 "With juvenile delinquency rampant, Germany's streets have been unsafe. We must enact an extensive programme of activities to rid our disillusioned youth of violent impulses."

GER_black_monday_reichstag_decisions:0 "Black Monday Policies"
GER_black_monday_reichstag_decisions_desc:0 "Black Monday has left the once mighty German economy in shambles, and economic experts say that the implications of the crash will lurk with us for years to come. The time has come to take firm, decisive action through wise statesmanship to fight back and bring some life back into the economy. Several proposals put forward by parties within the Reichstag are being debated to this end. The Kaiser has signaled that he expects action, and is likely to accept any feasible proposal that comes from the deliberations--Even one not fielded by a party found in the Cabinet.\n\nWe can only pass a total of four policies.\n\nPolicies Passed: ([?GER.GER_policies_passed|-0])"

GER_reichstag_in_progress:0 "Policy Being Implemented"

GER_bmr_SPD1:0 "SPD: Social Welfare"
GER_bmr_SPD1_desc:0 "With unemployment soaring to record rates, putting food on the table is becoming difficult for many families. No German should go hungry! Offering emergency assistance to help these people get back on their feet is not only a moral imperative of our administration, but a needed measure to prevent radicalisation and bring stability."

GER_bmr_SPD2:0 "SPD: Mixed Economy"
GER_bmr_SPD2_desc:0 "Black Monday has shown that the private sector simply cannot be fully trusted to make good, rational choices. The nationalisation of several failing industries within the Reich will bring much needed revenue and allow us to keep some people employed, as well."

GER_bmr_FVP1:0 "FVP: The Eight-Hour Workday"
GER_bmr_FVP1_desc:0 "While Industry insists that the ten hour workday is unquestionably needed to maximize productivity, the reality is that squeezing their labor to the bone has done little to stop the current economic crisis. Instituting a fourty-hour workweek will make life easier for the average factory worker, and hopefully force our industry to innovate and improve efficiency instead of simply stagnating."

GER_bmr_NLP1:0 "NLP: Opening the German Market"
GER_bmr_NLP1_desc:0 "Traditionally, the German Empire has taken a protectionist stance, preferring to sell and trade products within the sphere of Mitteleuropa. According to economist Ludwig von Mises, however, opening our market to the rest of the non-Syndicalist world and slashing barriers to trade has the potential to bring serious benefits. While undoubtedly a silly idea, it might just be worth a try."

GER_bmr_NLP2:0 "NLP: Easy Money"
GER_bmr_NLP2_desc:0 "In the current economic environment, banks are holding back on loaning money. By lowering interest rates and instituting an Easy Money policy, we can encourage our financial institutions to make riskier loans to citizens and increase cash flow."

GER_bmr_ZEN1:0 "Zentrum: Budget Discipline"
GER_bmr_ZEN1_desc:0 "We've faced tough times before, and we'll do it again. By cutting our expenses wherever we can and increasing taxes, we can secure the position of the German state in the face of this crisis... Though it's safe to say that very few people will be happy about this course of action."

GER_bmr_ZEN2:0 "Zentrum: Shakeout"
GER_bmr_ZEN2_desc:0 "After looking at the German industrial sector, it's obvious that many manufacturers are currently overproducing goods following the rapid drop in demand after Black Monday. We need to step aside and allow the market to adjust and re-consolidate; a little bit of pain now will make for a much more healthy economy later."

GER_bmr_DKP1:0 "DkP: A Steady Course"
GER_bmr_DKP1_desc:0 "After implementing the first steps of our economic recovery plan, the DkP simply wants to make sure that the rest of our strategy goes smoothly. As one of the most prominent political parties in Germany, the DkP is in a unique position to mediate disputes and keep a calm, steady status quo within the Reichstag and Germany as a whole."

GER_bmr_DKP2:0 "DkP: Agricultural Subsidies"
GER_bmr_DKP2_desc:0 "Farmers represent a substantial part of the DkP's base and a non-negligible part of the economy, too. Emphasizing Germany's agricultural sector in these trying times will help guarantee both their votes and a lower cost of food."

GER_bmr_DVLP1:0 "DVLP: Economic Mobilisation"
GER_bmr_DVLP1_desc:0 "Alfred Hugenberg's DVLP has been calling for increased military spending in the midst of Black Monday. The Kaiserreich's military is already substantial, and increasing this even further seems absurd, even if more recruitment could technically solve unemployment. Still, the infamous media magnate might just get his wish if he calls in a few favors."

GER_black_monday_mitteleuropa_decisions:0 "Black Monday Crisis in Mitteleuropa"

GER_bm_polish_nationalisation:0 "Approach Poland"
GER_bm_polish_nationalisation_desc:0 "With the economy slowly finding its track again, the time has maybe come to finally improve our economic ties with Poland. There has been some enthusiasm about this proposal in some circles. The Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano in particular has been a leading proponent of the idea."

GER_black_monday_colonies_decisions:0 "Black Monday Crisis in the Colonies"

GER_bm_sale_of_ceylon:0 "Sale of Ceylon"
GER_bm_sale_of_ceylon_desc:0 "Despite its natural resources, as a result of administrative inefficiencies the island of Ceylon is a very unprofitable part of our colonial empire, requiring massive investment every year. However, there have been proposals of selling the island to the Princely Federation - undoubtedly a profitable idea."

GER_thyssen:0 "Build up Thyssen"
GER_thyssen_desc:0 "Thyssen AG, actually a conglomerate of various companies, produce everything; coal, steel, ships, and even some consumer products. By investing into them, we can help build up the civilian sector of our economy to get stronger returns later."

GER_krupp_steel_focus:0 "Krupp Steel"
GER_krupp_steel_focus_desc:0 "All this talk about infrastructure and helping our citizens is nice, yes, but what about artillery? Tanks? Planes? The world isn't safe, and Friedrich Krupp AG has the solutions we need! They've served Germany for generations, and the time has come to call on them again."

GER_infra_1:0 "Deutsche Bahn"
GER_infra_1_desc:0 "Germany is a large, busy nation, and the most practical solution for transporting goods and supplies is definitely locomotives. Funding a quick project to touch up our rail-system and extend it to some more rural parts of the country will stimulate the economy and help connect the nation a bit more."

GER_infra_2:0 "Reichsautobahn"
GER_infra_2_desc:0 "Trains are now, but cars are the future. Reichskanzler Tirpitz ordered the construction of several highways throughout Germany, but the projects remain uncompleted--Worse, progress has all but stalled in the wake of Black Monday. We need to not only complete this project, but think even bigger..."

GER_infra_3:0 "Europabahn"
GER_infra_3_desc:0 "Mitteleuropa is large and impressive on paper, but we just aren't making the most of it. Several regions, especially Eastern Europe, are not connected to Germany properly. A main reason for this are the underdeveloped and poorly maintained rail systems that result in constant logistical bottlenecks. We can fix this, and we will."

GER_risky_industry:0 "Accelerate Recovery"
GER_risky_industry_desc:0 "This foolish talk of building up a 'strategic rear of industrial production' is not only idiotic, it's borderline treasonous! The Internationale, or anything else that might come from our Western border, for that matter, is not a credible threat. We need to focus on getting the economy up and running as soon as possible, and the best way to do that is by investing in the Rhineland and similar areas."

GER_risky_industry_1:0 "Revive the Rhineland"
GER_risky_industry_1_desc:0 "The Rhineland is one of the most productive and industrially prosperous areas in the world. Dealing with the ongoing turbulence the area is experiencing and defending it from the French will have to be a priority, but it's hard to argue that investing here could have serious payoff."

GER_risky_industry_2:0 "Building up Baden"
GER_risky_industry_2_desc:0 "Württemberg does not immediately come to mind when considering the industrial landscape of Germany, but this area is right next to the Rhine and the Danube. Making the right moves here could turn out well!"

GER_output:0 "Fund the Factories"
GER_output_desc:0 "We must manufacture more guns, planes, and tanks. There's no telling what our many enemies have in store for us, which means we have to be ready for everything. Not through great speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided, but by iron and blood!"

GER_safe_industry:0 "Emphasize Strategic Rear"
GER_safe_industry_desc:0 "Black Monday is both a problem and an immense opportunity. For years, the industrial heart of Germany has been extremely close to our unsafe western border. Should worst come to worst and we were to lose these areas, we'd be finished; however, if we were to invest in areas such as Silesia, far from the front, we could guarantee our ability to fight on in even the most terrible, unthinkable circumstances."

GER_safe_industry_1:0 "Silesian Steel"
GER_safe_industry_1_desc:0 "The Rhineland is a tempting target for investment, but it is important to remember that there's a variety of reasons why it's failing in the first place. The radicalisation of the workers and their wildcat strikes as of late doesn't bode well, and France being right next door could have dangerous implications. Silesia is a safer bet!"

GER_safe_industry_2:0 "Plans for Prussia"
GER_safe_industry_2_desc:0 "Prussia is the heart of Germany's history and governance, but not the heart of its industry. There's several reasons why this is the case, but no matter! Focusing on industrial buildup in the Kaiser's crownlands is certain to keep those factories as secure as we could hope for."

GER_construction:0 "Concentrate on Construction"
GER_construction_desc:0 "The economy is beginning to show some signs of life, and now is the time to push the program through to its natural conclusion. Whether through private investment, public funding, or the injection of foreign capital, let us begin building as much as we can as fast as we can."

#GER_industry_finished:0 "Economic Resurgance" already defined above
GER_industry_finished_desc:0 "With our economic policies following the Black Monday widely regarded as a resounding success, private investors have picked up on the lead, and the economy has not only stabilised but is currently experiencing a boom of sorts. It won't hold forever, but for the minute at least we can concentrate on other pressing issues."

GER_industry_research:0 "Construction I"
GER_industry_research_desc:0 "It's hard to fathom, but it seems we've fallen behind on industrial methodology and best practices! Perhaps this has something to do with the economy? In any case, now's as good a time as any to fix this."

GER_research_expansion:0 "Extra Research Funding"
GER_research_expansion_desc:0 "Investing in science and technology to stimulate advances in both military and civilian affairs. Isn't that an awfully good phrase? It doesn't really say anything, but it sure sounds good. Anyway, the laboratories are over there..."

GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "We can invest in IG Farben, a pharmaceuticals company currently researching ways to synthesise various chemical compounds that might prove useful to our interests."

GER_krupp_focus:0 "Krupp AG Contracts"
GER_krupp_focus_desc:0 "The Krupps are an almost 400 year old dynasty of industrious Germans, who have fed the Reich's war machine ever since the Thirty Years War! It is time we put them in state employment again, as their talents will be badly needed with a new Weltkrieg imminent."

GER_rearmament:0 "Aufrustung"
GER_rearmament_desc:0 "The world is getting less and less safe. The Syndicalists in France eye Elsaß-Lothringen greedily, Russia plunges into instability, and the Japanese wait for the right moment to hit us in the back to take Singapur. A focus on rearmament isn't going to be popular, but it's what we need right now if we want to keep our place in the sun."

GER_artillery_research:0 "Artillery Research"
GER_artillery_research_desc:0 "An area in which the German army has a longstanding tradition of lagging behind is the area of light support artillery. While the successes in building huge, unwieldy and impractical prestige objects such as the 'Paris Gun' can't be doubted, it's time to invest in some of the more practical - and more efficient - alternatives."

GER_doctrine_armor:0 "Armoured Breakthrough"
GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Another crucial point of Guderian and Manstein's new doctrine is the so-called Schwerpunkt. They believe that Panzer technology has advanced to a point where massed, mobile Panzer forces, with adequately equipped support troops, should be able to lead any offensive to victory. Now they need new Panzers to fit this idea."

#GER_doctrine_armor:0 "Panzer Research" already defined above
#GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Although the degree to which they are emphasized in our new doctrinal thinking varies, it is hard to deny that the tank is going to play a crucial role in warfare. Armor is uniquely equipped to support infantry, or to simply lead a spearhead. Regardless of what we intend to use them for, we're going to need more and better tanks." already defined above

GER_hahn_meitner:0 "Support Hahn & Meitner"
GER_hahn_meitner_desc:0 "Herr Hahn and Fräulein Meitner are both extremely talented physicists; Hahn is regularly published in science journals even in the Syndicalist bloc, and Meitner is a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute! Together, we believe, the two can help create extremely powerful tools for society. And even more powerful weapons."

GER_rocket:0 "Support von Braun"
GER_rocket_desc:0 "Von Braun is a notorious proponent for the field of 'Rocketry' and is the most accredited scientist for the field worldwide. He comes to us with the offer of new weaponised designs in return for sponsorship. We should heavily consider this."

GER_zuse:0 "Support Konrad Zuse"
GER_zuse_desc:0 "Konrad Zuse has already handed in several patents for what he calls a 'computing devices'. With proper sponsorship, his mind could be put to good use by the state, for the state."

GER_radar:0 "Support Rudolf Kühnhold"
GER_radar_desc:0 "Rudolf Kühnhold has some interesting ideas regarding a so-called 'radio measuring device'. This could give us a serious advantage on the sea, air, and even land, and might just be worth investing in."

GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society:0 "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society_desc:0 "Recent investments in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science have resulted in greater research capacity in various fields. If we officially endorse and promote the society as a place for state-sponsored research for state purposes, we should be able to attract some of the brightest minds of the new generation."

GER_black_monday_radio:0 "The Kanzler and the Radio"
#GER_black_monday_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the German's belief in their country. Reichskanzler von Papen hopes to turn the tide with weekly radio addresses in which he will announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis."
GER_black_monday_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the German's belief in their country. Public faith is key, so starting weekly radio addresses to announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis will help avoid panic and keep trust in our administration."

GER_groener1:0 "Liquidate Unprofitable Estates"
GER_groener1_desc:0 "The statesman Wilhelm Groener has recently published an essay titled 'The black zero: the need for austerity', in which he demands absolute balance discipline, even if it means losing some companies depending on subsidies. The essay has found a lot of adherents within the populace, and liquidating a few unprofitable companies may be just what we need to alleviate our expenditures."

GER_groener2:0 "Reichsarbeitsdienst"
GER_groener2_desc:0 "The contacts and friends of Groener in military circles have now proposed a radical innovation. For the duration of the crisis, recruits will be able to choose to fulfil half a year of military service as manual labourers in state service instead. While bad for recruitment numbers, this will inject some much needed labour into our economy."

GER_groener3:0 "Sale of Ceylon"
GER_groener3_desc:0 "Despite its natural resources, as a result of administrative inefficiencies the island of Ceylon is a very unprofitable part of our colonial empire, requiring massive investment every year. However, there have been proposals of selling the island to the Princely Federation - undoubtedly a profitable idea."

GER_schacht1:0 "Bail Out Junker Estates"
GER_schacht1_desc:0 "The president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, has demanded a green light to go ahead with his economic programme, dubbed the 'Schachtplan'. According to him, we need to bail out the highly indebted Junker estates if we don't want to trigger an even further descent into chaos."

GER_schacht2:0 "Investitionsprogramm"
GER_schacht2_desc:0 "The next part of the Schachtplan would be a massive programme aiming to encourage private investment, both into Mittelstand businesses as well as consumer products. While this will be hard to achieve, it should enable producers to find a market for their products again, which will hopefully help to restart the economy."

GER_schacht3:0 "Approach Poland"
GER_schacht3_desc:0 "With the economy slowly finding its track again, the time has maybe come to finally improve our economic ties with Poland. There has been some enthusiasm about this proposal in some circles. The Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano in particular has been a leading proponent of the idea."

GER_mitteleuropa:0 "One Currency for Mitteleuropa"
GER_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Now that Heinrich von Brentano and his friends of the European Friendship association have found their way into upper government circles, he has proposed another of his ideas. He proposes a single common currency, shared by all Mitteleuropan countries. This would, of course, never work. European friendship? What a silly idea."

GER_zollverein:0 "Reform Mitteleuropa"
GER_zollverein_desc:0 "For too long Mitteleuropa has existed in name only. It is time for is to start reforming it to actually benefit its members...and us. The first step is unified tariffs."

GER_synthetic:0 "Research in Synthetics"
GER_synthetic_desc:0 "In cooperation with members of the Kaiser Wilhelm society, IG Farben researchers have already been able to make astounding breakthroughs on the area of synthetic production. By giving them access to more funds, we might be able to make their research ready for mass implementation."

GER_experimental_research:0 "Experimental Research"
GER_experimental_research_desc:0 "While we have already made good progress in some of the more traditional fields relevant to industry - engineering, chemistry, physics - some of our scientists want funding to conduct research into some more esoteric matters. Though profit might not be as immediate, the long-term potential is immense!"

GER_black_monday_finish:0 "Finish Black Monday Reforms"
GER_black_monday_finish_desc:0 "It seemed impossible, but the numbers confirm it - the crisis is nearing its end. The key point is that it is not yet over. There are still millions without jobs, and civil society has been stretched to breaking point. The catastrophe of Black Monday will leave marks for a generation, but this is the beginning of the end."

GER_organize_the_youth:0 "Organise the Youth"
GER_organize_the_youth_desc:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness in our nation's youth would be organising them so that they can learn new skills and employ their energy for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."

GER_a_christian_trade_union:0 "A Christian Trade Union"
GER_a_christian_trade_union_desc:0 "By founding the Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund as a state-endorsed union, we will hopefully establish a bulwark against attacks on the workers' loyalty from left and right. Workers will be able to voice their concerns under the moral authority of priests and the guiding hand of the 'summus episcopus': the Kaiser."

GER_jet:0 "Cult of Aviation"
GER_jet_desc:0 "The image of the aviator has changed in the current conflict. They have replaced the cavalry as the image of the glorious and gallant war. Every child aspires to be an aviator and streak across the skies in his shining armour. By further fostering this image, we can motivate our pilots to give their very best in the service of the Reich."

GER_linie1:0 "Reactivate the Ludendorfflinie"
GER_linie1_desc:0 "The Syndicalist menace looms darker than ever. In fear of going into the next war unprepared, the reactivation of the old Ludendorfflinie on our western border is considered vital. Once one of the dictator's many costly prestige projects, the line of bunkers and fortifications has fallen into disuse in recent years. This is nothing that cannot be solved with a bit of engineering ingenuity!"

GER_linie2_full:0 "Over the Meuse and Far Away"
GER_linie2_full_desc:0 "Our puppet regime in Brüssel is screaming for help against the Syndicalists. Extending the reactivation of the Ludendorfflinie over the Meuse river and up to the North Sea coast would be costly and take up precious time - but it might enable us to make a stand on foreign soil so that not one German civilian is threatened."

GER_linie2_small:0 "Fortify Bastenach Alone"
GER_linie2_small_desc:0 "Our resources are stretched thin and time is of the essence. Even though Flanders-Wallonia may lie somewhat undefended compared to the Franco-German border, we cannot afford to waste time defending foreign territory that will be lost sooner or later anyway."

GER_linie3:0 "Fortify the Rhineland"
GER_linie3_desc:0 "The Rhineland is the most heavily industrialised region in the entire world and absolutely vital to our economy, both in peace and in war. All the same, it lies only a few miles away from a border that many have been eyeing nervously in recent months. In order to prepare against any eventualities, we should start extending the Ludendorflinie northwards."

GER_schule:0 "Paderborner Luftkriegsschule"
GER_schule_desc:0 "The establishment of a formalised school for our aviators would help immensely in unifying and promoting this currently somewhat disorganised field. There are a lot of heroes of air warfare from the Weltkrieg, the most famous of course being the Red Baron himself, whose insight can still be valuable to new recruits. There, they could impart their wisdom to a new generation of German pilots."

GER_institut:0 "Institut für Luftfahrttechnik"
GER_institut_desc:0 "An independent research organisation for aviation technology, the Institut für Luftfahrttechnik, could prove a major stepping stone on the way to ensuring German dominance not only on the ground and on the sea, but also in the skies."

GER_tactical_bombers:0 "Operational Flexibility"
GER_tactical_bombers_desc:0 "Our domain stretches worldwide, with military operations being possible in the Pacific, Atlantic, or in continental Europe. There's no telling what threats we're going to face, and thusly a focus on tactical bombers that can fulfill any number of tasks would be wise."

GER_heerflieger:0 "Keep the Fliegertruppe"
GER_heerflieger_desc:0 "Our aviators are currently organised as part of our army structure, without an independent air force command. This boosts cooperation between aviators and ground troops, and therefore leads to the current doctrine concentrating solely on that; air support with ground force primacy. This specialisation is suitable and should remain our policy."

GER_doitagain:0 "Listen to Sperrle"
GER_doitagain_desc:0 "Hugo Sperrle, a grim veteran pilot from the Weltkrieg, has gained some notoriety amongst our Fliegertruppe lately for his bold new doctrine. He proposes that converting our industrial might into all-out production of Strategic Bombers could win us the next war quicker and with fewer casualties by destroying the enemy's capacity and will to fight."

GER_luftwaffe:0 "An Independent Luftwaffe"
GER_luftwaffe_desc:0 "Since the Weltkrieg the Red Baron, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, has argued for the establishment of an independent air force - the Luftwaffe, as he likes to call it. Up until very recently, the conservative elements in the traditionally more prestigious ground forces have been able to prohibit this, but with war looming once again, it might be time to consider the Baron's idea."

GER_sturzflieger:0 "Sturzflieger"
GER_sturzflieger_desc:0 "One concept that has recently found a lot of supporters among aviation researchers is that of an aircraft that dives from great heights onto the battlefield to deliver its payload, using its momentum to climb again immediately afterwards. This concept, dubbed Sturzflieger, would minimise the time our precious aircraft would be in immediate danger."

GER_cas:0 "Coordinated Close Air Support"
GER_cas_desc:0 "The requirements and possible uses of close air support aircraft have proven to be far different from those of more mainstream fighter aircraft. If we concentrate our air research capabilities on identifying and exploiting the intricacies of this specialised form of air warfare, we should be able to achieve far better results in aircraft manufacturing."

GER_para:0 "Found the Luftlandetruppe"
GER_para_desc:0 "Due to our continuing focus on ground-air cooperation, there have been proposals of greatly expanding our Paratrooper division, which is currently in its infancy. This might have to do something with the fact that jumping from a flying plane does not seem very glorious or entertaining - or survivable, really. We should promote the image of the paratrooper as the spearhead of the Kaiser's military."

GER_bombergruppen:0 "Bombergruppen Doctrine"
GER_bombergruppen_desc:0 "One of the first results of the founding of Richthofen's Luftwaffe has been the invention of a new doctrine. This doctrine asserts that the possibilities of massed bomber warfare are exciting enough to warrant primacy over the traditional ground support. Fighters should not be used on the ground, where they can be subjected to anti-air attacks, but in the skies where they can escort bomber squadrons."

GER_singapore_airstrips:0 "Expand Singapur Airstrips"
GER_singapore_airstrips_desc:0 "Singapur is the centrepoint of German East Asia. A fortress city, it has great demands for both civilian as well as military airstrips. We should meet this pressing need by investing in construction to protect our naval station from foreign rivals in the region."

GER_finalise_centralisation_desc:0 "The independent postal services of the kingdoms of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany are some of the last remnants of the old federal structure of Germany.

Germany is not something you can opt out of!"

GER_disband_reichstag:0 "Disband the Reichstag"
GER_disband_reichstag_desc:0 "Reichskanzler von Schleicher has succeeded. The DVLP is once again the most influential party in Germany and Junkers occupy all ministerial posts of note. The only thing left to do is to formalise the new regime in the same way as Erich von Ludendorff did in 1919; dissolve and suspend the Reichstag for an indeteriminate period of time to bring peace, freedom, justice and security to this new Kaiserreich."

GER_sonderweg:0 "The German Sonderweg"
GER_sonderweg_desc:0 "Our path from aristocracy to democracy has been unlike any other in Europe and this is keenly reaffirmed within the new Sonderweg school of thought. We should embrace these democratic ideas as much as we can."

GER_parlamentsvertrauen:0 "End Prussian Constitutionalism"
GER_parlamentsvertrauen_desc:0 "After more than sixty years of battle against the authoritarian elements of the German establishment, the time has finally come to make Germany a democracy at last. From now on, the Reichskanzler and his government will no longer report to the Kaiser, but to the Reichstag and the people; There will be no more government against, but only of the people, by the people, for the people."

GER_democracy_in_prussia:0 "Democracy in Prussia"
GER_democracy_in_prussia_desc:0 "The current voting system in Prussia is archaic and undemocratic. The people are split into three strata according to their income, with the lowest strata, representing over sixty percent of the population, receiving as many delegates as the upper one, which represents less than ten percent! We should finally implement universal, secret and equal franchise for all citizens of Germany."

GER_easter_promises:0 "The Easter Promises"
GER_easter_promises_desc:0 "On April 7th 1917, when the war was at its very worst, after the horrifying 'Turnip Winter', the Kaiser promised substantial reforms and the abolition of the three-class voting system in Prussia. However, he promised all of that without offering an actual date. It might be time to remind the Kaiser of his promises..."

GER_minority_rights:0 "Guarantee Minority Rights"
GER_minority_rights_desc:0 "Traditionally, the Kaiserreich has pursued a hardline policy of Germanisation towards certain populations--Especially the French in Elsaß-Lothringen and the Polish in our eastern territories. While this process of integration should continue, we can gain some valuable goodwill by showing at least some hint of respect for them."

GER_rebuild_institutions:0 "A True Reichstag"
GER_rebuild_institutions_desc:0 "Over time, the Reichstag has become a glorified rubber stamp body that serves to approve the policies of the Reichkanzler appointed by the Kaiser. No longer!

GER_status_quo:0 "Guard the Balance"
GER_status_quo_desc:0 "It is true that the state of our government is not ideal, but the world is a dangerous place and the people's complaints never were all that relevant. We have neither the time nor resources to waste on populist reforms; the status quo suits us just fine."

GER_glorify_kaiser:0 "Glorify the Kaiser"
GER_glorify_kaiser_desc:0 "Starting from the humblest of origins in Brandenburg, the Hohenzollern dynasty guided Germany to unification and victory time and time again. The Kaiser is a symbol of the strength and unity of the German people, one that we should honor and respect. By continuing to concentrate power around him and the Reichkanzler, we can guarantee a safer and more stable future."

GER_embrace_faud:0 "Embrace the FAUD"

GER_women_suffrage:0 "Women's Suffrage"
GER_women_suffrage_desc:0 "While the Prussians now finally have their universal, secret and equal franchise, the women of Germany are still exempt from the vote. Awareness of this issue has been steadily rising, and clubs modelled on the British suffragettes are recruiting new members. If we want to avoid the public embarrassment that the British suffered in that affair, we should maybe consider fulfilling their requests."

GER_schleicher:0 "Schleicher's Kamarilla"
GER_schleicher_desc:0 "The Kaiser made von Schleicher Reichskanzler due to his promises to secure Germany against threats both from the democrats as well as the Junkers.

While conservative members of Reichstag are eager to leave the autonomous state unmolested, the bulk of our political establishment have already realised that Freistaat of Mittelafrika acts as a burden for both the German armed forces and our economy. Among the limited benefits the colony offers us is imperial prestige, and even then the Dark Continent is no longer seen in the same light as during Scramble for Afrika. Therefore, drastic reorganisation of this area is needed if we want to retain our presence in Afrika with while limiting our costs as much as possible."

The AOG-held provinces of China are an abberation in many ways so it is important that we consider our policy position towards them. Though senior conservatives see our Place in the Sun as inviolable and the status quo perfectly acceptable, modernising influences in the Reichstag have argued that the economic model represented by the AOG's administration is no longer effective and keeping it intact will eventually result in massive dissent in the Chinese population. If this happens, our military forces, currently overstretched policing our massive empire and pivoting towards Europe in the face of Communard aggression, may not be able to contain such a revolt."

They publicly condemned what they call 'German Imperialism' and pledged to do everything possible to protect the French minority within the Reich. In response, several important members of the international community similarly condemned our actions against the French population, stating that such actions are a stain on the honour of a modern state.

These doughty soldiers have served the Reich faithfully ever since the chancellor outwitted the Entente in the jungles of Ostafrika during the Weltkrieg. Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck has also proposed that we grant the native kings, princes and vassals that rule Afrika in our stead complete independence once we retake our Vaterland. Such a reward would incentivise our native population and leaders and invigorate them to assist us in getting to Berlin. This is a desperate proposal, but the Reich is going through desperate times."

gerdom.95.d:0 "The site of some of the most impressive battles fought by the German colonial army under von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg, Ostafrika, with its capital of Daressalam, is seen by most officials as the jewel in the crown of the Reich's African possessions. As such the German administration is deeply entrenched here and cooperation with the natives run smoothly, resulting in a large turnout of volunteers for the new Schutztruppen."

gerdom.96.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Kongo"
gerdom.96.d:0 "Taken from the defeated Belgian state after the Weltkrieg, the Congo occupies the heart of Central Africa and has for decades of German administration been heavily militarised to secure the Reich's control over the province."

gerdom.99.d:0 "Consisting of the original German colony of Togo and the annexed British and French colonies of the Gold Coast and Dahomey, the askaris formed here are of a notably lesser quality than seen elsewhere in Mittelafrika.

Underground French Syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning the minds of our French minority with propaganda, with many using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, right-wing members of our government have demanded the complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation in the international community..."

After serving abroad as Syndicalist volunteer, Brecht was blocked from re-entering Germany.\n\nHis family, together with other Syndicalist elements, staged scale demonstrations in Berlin, blaming our hardline policy towards Syndicalist volunteers for his death."
gerdom.207.a:0 "It seems that we have created a martyr."

gerdom.208.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Returns to Germany"
gerdom.208.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems like the Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has somehow managed to smuggle himself over the border. He and his family have gone underground and the controversial figure is openly preaching for solidarity by the workers against the capitalist system."
gerdom.208.a:0 "Can't he ever shut up?!"

gerdom.209.t:0 "International Divisions Offer Their Service"
gerdom.209.d:0 "After valiantly fighting for the Syndicalist cause, the comrades and veterans of the International Divisions have cowardly been denied entrance to their own homeland in Germany. After months of drifting, many of the former members have now reassembled and decided to take up arms to liberate Germany from the scourge of imperialism. While their numbers have been reduced by fighting and poverty, they are battle-hardened veterans and would make a worthy addition to the forces of the Internationale."
gerdom.209.a:0 "Welcome comrades!"
gerdom.209.b:0 "A needless expense."

### Foreign Events ###

gerfor.1.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Denmark"
gerfor.1.d:0 "The Union of Britain has declared war on Denmark. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Danish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Denmark?"
gerfor.1.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face German arms!"
gerfor.1.b:0 "We have enough problems to be dealing with."

gerfor.2.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Denmark"
gerfor.2.d:0 "The Second Reich has sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Denmark and declare a ceasefire or Germany will come to Denmark's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the Skagerrak and pose a dangerous threat to Germany on its northern border, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
gerfor.2.a:0 "We will not risk war with Germany over this."
gerfor.2.b:0 "We do not negotiate with imperialists."

gerfor.3.t:0 "German Assistance Against Britain"
gerfor.3.d:0 "We are in a state of war with the Union of Britain. Our military, while proud, will not be able to withstand the Syndicalist onslaught. Some influential figures are petitioning us to ask the Germans for help, even if it might mean having to accept some German influence after the invasion is repelled. What shall we do?"
gerfor.3.a:0 "Thank you Berlin!"
gerfor.3.b:0 "The Germans cannot be trusted."

gerfor.4.t:0 "Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.4.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the British Isles. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today. We have shown the world that we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or the Commune."
gerfor.4.a:0 "Yet again German diplomacy wins the day."

gerfor.5.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Denmark Ultimatum"
gerfor.5.d:0 "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Danish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Denmark into our alliance or we can stand down and let Denmark fall, creating a northern front with our Syndicalist foe."
gerfor.5.a:0 "They have made their choice, war it is!"
gerfor.5.b:0 "Back down. There will be peace in our time."

gerfor.6.t:0 "Britain Backs Down Over Denmark"
gerfor.6.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders ordering an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to British territory. Denmark's independence has been preserved and our pride left intact. All the same, the fact that it took German intervention to protect us is somewhat unsettling."
gerfor.6.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without them."

gerfor.7.t:0 "Internationale Seeks to Reunify Italy"
gerfor.7.d:0 "The combined forces of the French Commune and the Socialist Republic of Italy have launched an attempt to seize the entirety of Italy. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in Europe in favour of the Syndicalists. Shall we warn the Internationale that this threatens world peace or let the peninsula fall to their malignant ideology?"

gerfor.8.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Italy"
gerfor.8.d:0 "The German Empire has sent us a telegram, demanding that either we end our intervention in Italy and declare a ceasefire with the Italian states or the Reich will intervene by force."

gerfor.9.t:0 "Germany Sends the Internationale an Ultimatum"
gerfor.9.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France over their support for the Socialist Republic of Italy in its attempts to conquer the entire peninsula. The Germans demand that the Syndicalists fall back or risk utter annihilation."

gerfor.10.t:0 "Commune of France Withdraws from Italy"
gerfor.10.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris, they quickly withdrew their forces from the frontlines and abandoned the peninsula. Our independence will be preserved, and our pride left intact."
gerfor.10.d.sri:0 "Drawing [FRA.GetNameDef] into our war with [ITA.GetNameDef] was perhaps not the wisest idea. The war drew the attention of the Reich which issued an ultimatum to [FRA.GetNameDef] to cease the invasion. The [FRA.GetAdjective] government has complied, ordering our own forces to stand down. We have little choice but to comply."

gerfor.11.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Italy"
gerfor.11.d:0 "After we sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France to cease their intervention in Italy and backing for the Italian Syndicalists in the war, they wisely decided to comply. Already Red forces are withdrawing and our prestige has been greatly heightened. Yet again we have used diplomacy to help guard the balance, and improve prospects for European peace."

gerfor.12.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Italian Ultimatum"
gerfor.12.d:0 "Our ultimatum was flatly ignored. Already SRI and Communard forces are on the march in Italy and refusing to return to their pre-war boundaries. The other states of the Italian peninsula are threatened existentially and Syndicalism is poised to spread its vile ideology to every corner of the land. The issue now is, do we back up our ultimatum with force and declare war on the Internationale?"

gerfor.13.t:0 "Commune of France Invades Spain"
gerfor.13.d:0 "The armed forces of the Commune of France have launched an invasion of the Spanish state. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the syndicalist alliance. Shall we warn the syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or let Spain fall?"

gerfor.14.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Spain"
gerfor.14.d:0 "Monarchies are as thick as thieves. After we began our campaign against the Spanish kingdom we received a message from Berlin ordering us to cease and desist in our military efforts. They claim that if we do not bring our forces back beyond the Pyrenees they will intervene militarily to preserve the current status quo."

gerfor.16.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Spain"
gerfor.16.d:0 "The Germans have achieved a significant diplomatic coup today, and helped preserve our independence. After the Reich sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France ordering them to cease their military aggression towards us, the French wisely decided to comply and brought their troops back from beyond the Pyrenees. The status quo remains, for now at least, intact."

gerfor.17.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Spanish Ultimatum"
gerfor.17.d:0 "Despite our public condemnation of the Communard invasion of the Spanish Kingdom and subsequent ultimatum, the French have refused to pull their forces back. The possibility of the loss of yet another European monarchy can no longer be discounted, and the choice is now incumbent on us to decide how we should respond to this flagrant dismissal of German hegemony."

gerfor.18.t:0 "Liberation of Flandern-Wallonien"
gerfor.18.d:0 "We have retaken Flandern-Wallonien from our Communard enemies. The collapse of our regime in the kingdom posed a dangerous threat to our fortunes on the western front, and this victory has already greatly improved German morale. The question now is - should we liberate it, divide it, or keep it for ourselves?"
gerfor.18.a:0 "Liberate them! Flandern-Wallonien fights again!"
gerfor.18.b:0 "Divide Flanders-Wallonia."
gerfor.18.c:0 "We will occupy them, for now at least."

#gerfor.19.t:0 "Fate of Southern Wallonia"
#gerfor.19.d:0 "With the situation stabilised on the western front to an extent, the time has come to settle a long unresolved issue. Should we give the provinces of southern Wallonia back to their rightful owner in the name of peace or shall we make clear our plans of fully integrating this province into the German Empire as a new federal state?"
#gerfor.19.a:0 "Return it to its rightful owner."
#gerfor.19.b:0 "Integrate Deutsch-Wallonia."

#gerfor.20.t:0 "German Returns Southern Wallonia"
#gerfor.20.d:0 "With the Reichspakt standing relatively strong on the western front Germany has seen fit to return the southern Wallonian provinces seized to us. Cities such as Bastogne and Malmedy, seized after the Peace With Honour, are finally back in our hands."
#gerfor.20.a:0 "Such kindness!"

#gerfor.22.t:0 "Partition of the Netherlands"
#gerfor.22.d:0 "After much fighting have finally taken control of the Netherlands. Perhaps should we split it with our loyal ally Flandern-Wallonien?"
#gerfor.22.a:0 "Partition it."
#gerfor.22.b:0 "Restore a Dutch state."
#gerfor.22.c:0 "Military occupation is preferable."

#gerfor.23.t:0 "Partition of the Netherlands"
#gerfor.23.d:0 "The Germans have chosen to hand over to us our rightful part of the Netherlands. We cannot exactly say we were expecting such benevolence from the Reich, but it is mostly certainly welcome."
#gerfor.23.a:0 "Neat."

gerfor.24.t:0 "Enemy at the Gates"
gerfor.24.d:0 "The Russians have reached the Oder. There has been little outright panicking in Berlin but it is clear that without a counter-attack Germany is greatly endangered. The last supply reserves have been distributed to volunteers and everyone is participating in this last effort to defend the Vatherland."
gerfor.24.a:0 "Not one step back!"

gerfor.25.t:0 "Die Wacht am Rhein"
gerfor.25.d:0 "The French have reached the Rhine. Our substantial border fortifications were seemingly unable to stop their inexorable advance and now our crucial industrial cities are falling one after another. The situation is quite dire, and already there are treasonous murmurings that the Communards could reach Berlin itself."
gerfor.25.a:0 "They must be stopped!"

gerfor.26.t:0 "Fate of Spanish Morocco"
gerfor.26.d:0 "With Syndicalist forces taking control of Spain our colonial possessions in North Africa might be endangered. As a preventive measure our general staff has suggested that we occupy Spanish Morocco before the CNT-FAI stabilise their rule and spread their foul influence into our colonies."
gerfor.26.a:0 "Occupy Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.26.b:0 "Dirt piles are beneath our concern right now."

gerfor.27.t:0 "Germany Occupies Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.27.d:0 "The German Empire, in a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."
gerfor.27.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
gerfor.27.b:0 "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

gerfor.28.t:0 "Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.28.d:0 "The island of Madagascar has been under our rule for several decades and it is an untapped source of rare timbers like ebony and several varieties of rosewood. As these sources have not been exploited, several industrialists and members of the colonial government have proposed that we establish a joint-stock company with authority over the timber industry on the island. Shall we decree the establishment of such a company?"
gerfor.28.a:0 "Create a new joint-stock company."
gerfor.28.b:0 "Leave the industry alone."

gerfor.29.t:0 "Expanded Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.29.d:0 "The joint-stock company that we established has began to show some results and our inventory of rare timber has steadily increased. However, with the mechanisation of logging, several thousand locals have been put out of work. The company has at the same time advised that we begin construction on a new timber processing plant to streamline production. If we were to fund this new project it would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."
gerfor.29.a:0 "Create the new processing complex."
gerfor.29.b:0 "In this economy?"

gerfor.30.t:0 "New Madagascan Processing Complex"
gerfor.30.d:0 "The new timber processing complex has opened and the transformative effects on the local economy were immediate. Many workers responsible for the initial construction were retained by the company and many new workers were needed after construction was complete, dramatically increasing employment in the area. The access to rare timbers has also increased and a gala was held in Tananarive to toast the new complex's opening."
gerfor.30.a:0 "A successful colonial endeavour."

gerfor.31.t:0 "Uprising on Madagascar"
gerfor.31.d:0 "With no end in sight to the rising unemployment on Madagascar, many Malagasy locals, and especially the former loggers, have risen against us. What started as merely a local insurrection quickly spiralled into outright rebellion with an independence war brewing."
gerfor.31.a:0 "We really don't need this right now..."

gerfor.32.t:0 "A Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.32.d:0 "With the fall of France our armed forces have unsuccessfully tried to gain control over the British Isles and decisively end the war in our favour. Unfortunately, Republican resistance has proven stronger than we previously anticipated, and attempts to launch a full-scale naval invasion have soured. We can now either continue the armed struggle or try to end this futile conflict by way of a peace treaty."
gerfor.32.a:0 "It is time for an armistice."
gerfor.32.b:0 "This will only end with German boots marching through London."

gerfor.33.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.33.d:0 "Attempts from the Reichspakt to gain a foothold on our island and decisively end the war have failed miserably. Though the collapse of the Commune was a terrible blow to the Revolutionary cause, British arms have proven to be too much for Jerry to handle. Now the leadership of the German Empire is offering us a proposal - to terminate conflict between the Reichspakt and the remaining members of Internationale in exchange for mutual recognition. How shall we react?"
gerfor.33.a:0 "Survival is all we can hope for. Sign."
gerfor.33.b:0 "Another humiliation? Never again!"

gerfor.34.t:0 "Second Peace with Honour Signed"
gerfor.34.d:0 "It is finally done. Though we had hoped for the total obliteration of the Union of Britain and the end to Syndicalist influence in Europe, alas it was not to be. Instead the British wisely decided to make terms with us, signing the treaty in sight of a full German military parade. With this the bulk of the fighting is now over, and the Second Weltkrieg virtually ended in Europe."
gerfor.34.a:0 "Peace at last!"

gerfor.35.t:0 "The British Refused Peace!"
gerfor.35.d:0 "In a staggering display of British stubbornness, the Syndicalist wretches flatly denied our calls for a peace treaty. Instead of swallowing their pride and accepting the inevitable, the Republican government said that they would not have a Second Peace With Honour, and would end the war by marching through Berlin."
gerfor.35.a:0 "They will pay for this insolence."

gerfor.36.t:0 "Ethnic Conflict on Sri Lanka"
gerfor.36.d:0 "Ceylon Island is settled by Sinhalese and Tamils, who have battled for supremacy on the island for ages. With Black Monday wreaking havoc on our economy and colonial administration, disobedience from the native population is becoming intolerable. Our presence on Ceylon, crucial for its supplies of rubber, is becoming increasingly precarious."
gerfor.36.a:0 "Damn those nationalists!"

gerfor.37.t:0 "Union of Britain Invades Norway"
gerfor.37.d:0 "The Union of Britain has made the bold move of declaring war on the Norwegians, seeking to impose Syndicalism on them by force of arms. This invasion shows scant regard for German supremacy in Europe and the status quo that we have spent years maintaining. The question now is, what should our response to be this act of barbarism by the British?"

gerfor.38.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Norway"
gerfor.38.d:0 "We have received a damning telegram from the Reich. They are demanding that either we cease our invasion of Norway or face the full might of the Kaiserliche Marine. They cite the inviolability of sovereign European nations and a whole lot of guff about guarding the balance, but everyone knows that this act stems from German's desperate attempts to hold onto their hegemonic status on the continent. What should our response be?"

gerfor.39.t:0 "Germany Warns the Union of Britain over Norway"
gerfor.39.d:0 "Germany has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain, either fall back to their home islands or risk annihilation."

gerfor.40.t:0 "The Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.40.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or France."

gerfor.41.t:0 "Britain Ignores our Norwegian Ultimatum"
gerfor.41.d:0 "In a display of repugnant audacity, the Union of Britain ignored our ultimatum. North Sea operations do not seem to have altered at all and the Republicans are continuing the war against Norway. We cannot risk the red tide of Syndicalism sinking its tendrils into yet another nation, particularly one important to our strategic interests. At the same time, open war with London would distract us at an inopportune time and potentially lead to the Internationale joining in."

gerfor.42.t:0 "The British Withdraw from Norway"
gerfor.42.d:0 "The Union of Britain appears to have listened to wise counsel, and ceased their operations in the North Sea. The German ultimatum appears to have scared them off, and Syndicalism stopped from claiming yet another scalp."

gerfor.43.t:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
gerfor.43.d:0 "With the Syndicalists awakening all over the world it is crucial for the Reichspakt to help potential allies whenever possible. With Irish sympathies swayed towards Germany due to our support during the War of Independence there now exists the possibility of gaining a strong foothold just under the socialists' noses by getting Ireland into the Reichspakt. We should start by offering them equipment and construction support."
gerfor.43.a:0 "Offer Ireland aid if they join the Reichspakt."

gerfor.44.t:0 "German Offers Support"
gerfor.44.d:0 "The German ambassador has approached us with an offer: if Ireland signs a treaty of association with the Reichspakt Germany will invest in our economy and military. While the benefits from this deal would be immense there are some in the government who are unwilling to rely on foreign aid."
gerfor.44.a:0 "Where do I sign?"
gerfor.44.b:0 "We are doing fine on our own."

gerfor.45.t:0 "Ireland Signs the Treaty"
gerfor.45.d:0 "The Irish have agreed to our offer. According to the treaty we are to supply industrial machines and the licences required to construct additional ones in Ireland itself. Additionally, we are obliged to construct and deliver guns, artillery pieces, and a number of aircraft and armour pieces to bolster their armed forces."
gerfor.45.a:0 "Begin the construction then!"

gerfor.46.t:0 "Ireland Refuses the Treaty"
gerfor.46.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Irish have decided to turn our offer down. Still, our obligations towards Ireland remain the same as they were before."
gerfor.46.a:0 "Oh well."

gerfor.47.t:0 "Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.47.d:0 "We have finally finished preparations of all of the material ordered by the Irish as part of our treaty obligations. The goods are now ready to be delivered and we will give the convoy a military escort all the way to the Ireland."
gerfor.47.a:0 "Get it to Dublin, posthaste."

gerfor.48.t:0 "German Aid Arrives"
gerfor.48.d:0 "The guns, armour, aircraft and industrial machinery that Germany promised us as part of their treaty obligations have finally arrived. We have received a squadron each of fighters and bombers, a number of tanks as well as many artillery pieces and new German machine guns. This could be the first step in a fruitful relationship."
gerfor.48.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.49.t:0 "Our Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.49.d:0 "Unfortunately, with Ireland no longer able or willing to receive our aid the whole programme had to be aborted. Luckily, the equipment and craft already produced remain in our hands and is ready to be used."
gerfor.49.a:0 "Better than nothing."

gerfor.51.t:0 "Germany Requests Austrian Support"
gerfor.51.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, Germany treated us rather shabbily when it came to the Brest-Litovsk divisions, with Poland and Ukraine being forced from our sphere of influence by the glory-hogging Reich. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.51.a:0 "The Kaisers will fight together again!"
gerfor.51.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.51.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.52.t:0 "Germany Requests Ottoman Support"
gerfor.52.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, with the end of the Weltkrieg the Germans refused to assist us in our recovery despite fighting with them virtually unnecessarily, and instead the Reich continued to exploit our serious foreign debt problems. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.52.a:0 "The Sultan shall aid the Reich!"
gerfor.52.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.52.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.53.t:0 "Germany Requests Bulgarian Support"
gerfor.53.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, despite our contributions to the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg being recognised to an extent, Germany seized control of Romania's coveted oil supplies for itself and has neglected us ever since. The question now is whether we should assist the Reich?"
gerfor.53.a:0 "We owe them. It is time to repay the debt!"
gerfor.53.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.53.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.54.t:0 "Austria Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.54.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.54.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.55.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.55.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.55.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.56.t:0 "Bulgaria Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.56.d:0 "Bulgaria listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.56.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.57.t:0 "Austria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.57.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea but pointedly refused to help us in our time of need. We stand alone in our struggle against Syndicalism."
gerfor.57.a:0 "Shameful."

gerfor.58.t:0 "The Ottomans Refused to Help"
gerfor.58.d:0 "Despite all of our exhortations the Sultan refused to support us at all in our fight against the Internationale."
gerfor.58.a:0 "Damn him!"

gerfor.59.t:0 "Bulgaria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.59.d:0 "The Bulgarians ignored our call for support and instead decided to stay out of the crusade against the Syndicalists. It is not like a Balkan country to avoid a fight."
gerfor.59.a:0 "Traitorous curs."

gerfor.60.t:0 "Austria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.60.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help but decided not to join our alliance or begin military operations against the Internationale. Instead they will send supplies and volunteers to help in our struggle against Syndicalism!"
gerfor.60.a:0 "It's better than nothing!"

gerfor.61.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Promises Some Support"
gerfor.61.d:0 "Though the Sultan was sympathetic to our cause, he made it clear that he did not wish to drag his realm into a needless war with the Internationale. Instead he promised to give us material support and to send volunteers."
gerfor.61.a:0 "The irony is palpable."

gerfor.62.t:0 "Bulgaria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.62.d:0 "The Bulgarian government did not wish to offer us overt military support, believing that though Syndicalism is a terrible plague, war with the Communards would be pointless. They promised to at least give us some equipment and volunteers."
gerfor.62.a:0 "Thank you Bulgaria."

gerfor.63.t:0 "Germany Requests Trondheim Leasehold"
gerfor.63.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has approached our ambassador with a somewhat strange offer: we have been offered a substantial sum of money if we lease them our harbour of Trondheim for twenty-five years, to allow for the creation of a forward base against the Republican navy of the Union of Britain. The Norwegian inhabitants would be allowed to stay, as would our civilian administration, and the boost to commerce in the region would be immense. However, the Syndicalists might decide to retaliate against us if we agree to the offer...\n\nWhat shall we do?"
gerfor.63.a:0 "Money is good!"
gerfor.63.b:0 "We can't anger the British!"

gerfor.64.t:0 "Norway Agrees Trondheim Lease"
gerfor.64.d:0 "The Norwegian government has decided to agree to our offer of leasing Trondheim for the next twenty-five years! A small commission is already on its way to assess the level of investment required to make Trondheim an integral part of our defence against Syndicalism."
gerfor.64.a:0 "Very good."

gerfor.65.t:0 "Norway does not agree to lease Trondheim"
gerfor.65.d:0 "The Norwegian government has decided to not agree to our offer of leasing Trondheim for the next twenty-five years, citing the threat of British retaliation. While understandable and not unexpected, this is still unfortunate."
gerfor.65.a:0 "Kiel will have to be good enough."

gerfor.66.t:0 "Deal with the Devil?"
gerfor.66.d:0 "We have been defeated by the Syndicalist bastards but the Entente still fights on. While it was the inability of their governments to hold on to their lands that led to this whole mess in the first place, many say that we should put aside our differences and join with the Entente to reclaim our homeland."
gerfor.66.a:0 "Talk to the Entente."
gerfor.66.b:0 "We do not need them!"

gerfor.67.t:0 "Germany Seeks to Join the Entente"
gerfor.67.d:0 "The Germans have been defeated by the Syndicalist usurpers. While it was their fault that the Syndicalists have taken control of Europe they are now in the same position as we were just a few years ago. Surprisingly, the Germans have sent a delegate to the Canadian government asking for an alliance. What will our terms be?"
gerfor.67.a:0 "Let them join."
gerfor.67.b:0 "Allow them into the Entente with concessions."
gerfor.67.c:0 "Germany in an anti-German alliance? Madness!"

gerfor.68.t:0 "Entente Talks With Germany"
gerfor.68.d:0 "With the German Reich having been smashed in its heartland by the Internationale, they have fled Europe and now seek desperately to regain their power. They have begun talks with the Canadian administration about joining the Entente itself, in an effort to unite all of our efforts against the Syndicalists. The question now is what us French can exact from the Germans, culpable as they are for this entire mess."
gerfor.68.a:0 "Demand Alsace-Lorraine!"
gerfor.68.b:0 "Demand Alsace-Lorraine and part of their colonies!"
gerfor.68.c:0 "Demand nothing from the Germans."

gerfor.69.t:0 "Entente Talks Successful"
gerfor.69.d:0 "The Entente has accepted our alliance proposal and they haven't requested anything in return! This is the best offer we could hope for!"
gerfor.69.a:0 "Sign the treaty!"
gerfor.69.b:0 "No, we've changed our minds."

gerfor.70.t:0 "Entente Talks Successful"
gerfor.70.d:0 "The Entente has accepted our alliance proposal! Canada, however, has requested that in return we must enter negotiations regarding our claims on former British colonies which we took after the war. Should we still sign the treaty?"
gerfor.70.a:0 "Sign the treaty!"

gerfor.71.b:0 "No, the price is too high."

gerfor.72.t:0 "Entente Talks Successful"
gerfor.72.d:0 "The Entente has accepted our alliance proposal, but both the French and British governments in exile have requested something in return. Canada has requested we enter negotiations regarding our claims on former British colonies which we took after the war and France has demanded Alsace-Lorraine back. Should we still sign the treaty?"

gerfor.73.t:0 "Entente Talks Successful"
gerfor.73.d:0 "The Entente has accepted our alliance proposal. While Canada has requested nothing in return, France has demanded that we give them back their colonies after the war, reversing the seizures we made after the 1919 French Revolution. Should we still sign the treaty"

gerfor.80.d:0 "The Hawaiian government has decided to not agree to our offer of giving our navy basing rights in their harbours, without citing a direct reason - however, it's widely suspected that a fear of us meddling in their affairs was the reason for this. While understandable and not unexpected, this is still unfortunate."

gerfor.81.t:0 "German 'Warning'"
gerfor.81.d:0 "The termination of Romanian oil shipments to Germany has made them dissatisfied and irate, to say the least.

gerfor.94.t:0 "Ottomans Accept the Oil Treaty"

gerfor.100.t:0 "Cairo Pact Begins Oil Shipments"
gerfor.100.d:0 "Within minutes of our diplomats requesting the oil shipments, word came to us that the call had been made. Already a German-flagged tanker docked in the Suez has been laden with barrels of oil. It seems almost miraculous."
gerfor.100.a:0 "The magic of diplomacy."

gerfor.101.t:0 "Cairo Pact Betrayal!"

gerfor.110.t:0 "Venezuela Lost Our Oil!"
gerfor.110.d:0 "Despite the isolation of South America it appears that somehow Venezuela was unable to keep our oil safe. Our previously uninterrupted supply chain has fallen apart and oil shortages are already making themselves known in the Vaterland and across our colonial empire."
gerfor.110.a:0 "Why is it always the oil?"

gerfor.111.t:0 "Commercial Vessels Refuse to Sail to Venezuela!"
gerfor.111.d:0 "With us being at war we need all of the manpower we can get, and our vital oil supply links with Venezuela have become dependent on civilian ships transporting much of our oil. Unfortunately it is becoming increasingly clear that due to the danger of ships being sunk commercial shippers are becoming reluctant to take the oil, which is causing our oil imports to drop precipitously. Yet again our oil supplies are severely endangered."

gerfor.119.d:0 "Russia has been threatening Azerbaijan, which controls the Baku Oil Fields, an region incredibly rich with the so-called black gold. We must ensure that Russia does not take these oil fields, and if possible, secure them for ourselves. We are going to hold a conference in Baku in order to negotiate with Azerbaijan the best way forward, by ensuring the survival of the Azeri state - and more importantly, the oil they hold."

gerfor.122.c:0 "Demand direct control over Azeri oil fields."

gerfor.123.t:0 "Oil for a Guarantee"
gerfor.123.d:0 "The German proposal ended up being suprisingly tame, asking simply for a monthly import of oil in exchange for them guaranteeing our independence, essentially keeping us safe from Russia for as long as this deal lasts. It would be foolish to refuse."
gerfor.123.a:0 "Very reasonable."
gerfor.123.b:0 "We can't give up our oil."

gerfor.124.t:0 "Baku Conference is Successful"

gerfor.125.b:0 "Threaten Azerbaijan with war."

gerfor.126.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
gerfor.126.d:0 "Due to our recent refusal of the German deal at the Baku Conference, it seems the German government has threatened us with war if we do not accept their demands. The choice seems clear here, as war with the Kaiserreich would almost certainly mean the end."

gerfor.127.b:0 "We are no warmongerers."

gerfor.128.t:0 "Germany Demands Oil and an Embargo on Russia"
gerfor.128.d:0 "Germany's demands were a bit more radical then expected, with them not only demanding oil but also for us to embargo Russia in order to cut off their oil supplies. While our independence will still be gaurenteed, Russia will bear much more resentment towards us. In the long run this could pose serious risk to our nation."
gerfor.128.a:0 "We'll accept."
gerfor.128.b:0 "We can't embargo Russia, but the oil is fine."
gerfor.128.c:0 "This was a bad idea."

gerfor.129.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts the Oil Treaty"

gerfor.130.t:0 "Azerbaijan Changes the Deal"
gerfor.130.d:0 "Azerbaijan has changed the treaty to a much more mild approach, removing the Russian embargo clause so that we only get oil from them.

gerfor.130.b:0 "Take it or leave it."

gerfor.131.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Give Concessions"
gerfor.131.d:0 "Germany has refused our tamer approach at the conference, and stated that the deal will be off if we do not both guarantee oil supplies and embargo the Russians. It seems we can't make them budge on this point, so acceptance may be our only option. The alternative could be catastrophic."
gerfor.131.a:0 "Fine then."
gerfor.131.b:0 "Then the conference will end here."

gerfor.132.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refuses Again"
gerfor.132.d:0 "Azerbaijan has refused our deal yet again, and officially put an end to the Baku Conference. The only option left if we want the oil fields is to threaten them with war. The puny state would be foolish to resist us."

gerfor.133.a:0 "Give them their damn treaty."
gerfor.133.b:0 "This is ridiculous!"

gerfor.134.t:0 "Germany Demands Direct Control of Our Oil Fields"
gerfor.134.d:0 "The German diplomats have claimed in the conference that the Azeri government and industrial sector is not equipped to properly exploit the oil deposits in the country. They have recommended allowing them to have complete oversight of our industries by placing German directors into key positions in state-owned oil companies, meaning that together we can access even more oil. While we could all get rich off the deal, the problem is that this could possibly threaten our position as an independent nation."
gerfor.134.a:0 "Well alright then..."
gerfor.134.b:0 "Economic influence is enough, we shall have no directors."
gerfor.134.c:0 "Refuse outright."

gerfor.135.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts!"
gerfor.135.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted our recent deal, giving us direct control over their oil fields and industry. This essentially makes them another one of our subjects, securing oil for a very long time."
gerfor.135.a:0 "Let the black gold flow."

gerfor.136.t:0 "Azerbaijan Varies the Treaty"
gerfor.136.d:0 "Azerbaijan has vetoed the idea of us having our directors manage their oil companies, and they only wish to have economic guidance. Our influence over the country and its oil supplies would still be immense, though substantially less than with our German oversight of the oil industry itself."
gerfor.136.a:0 "We'll accept the change."
gerfor.136.b:0 "It's this or nothing!"

gerfor.137.t:0 "Germany Accepts the Modified Treaty"
gerfor.137.d:0 "Germany has accepted our version of the treaty, which help us get more out of our oil fields and whilst also gaining us a guarantee from the Reich. In exchange all we need do is ensure that the oil supply remains unmolested and that the shipments reach Germany."
gerfor.137.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.138.t:0 "Germany Reaffirms the Original Proposal"
gerfor.138.d:0 "The Reich's diplomats have seemingly not budged on their position on having German directors control our oil fields, and this is simply unacceptable for us as it essentially makes us a puppet of Germany. Unfortunately the threat of war is present if we refuse. How do we respond?"
gerfor.138.a:0 "It's this or war."
gerfor.138.b:0 "Maybe the Russians will help?"
gerfor.138.c:0 "We said no the first time, we'll say it again."

gerfor.139.t:0 "Azerbaijan Requests Assistance"
gerfor.139.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Baku Conference between Germany and Azerbaijan over the oil supply, tensions have been heating up. Germany has now formally threatened them with war. Azeri diplomats have sent a telegram asking for our assistance in the matter, and a reward of oil might be in it for us if we help. The question is, should we pressure Germany to back down?"
gerfor.139.a:0 "Send a stern message to Germany."
gerfor.139.b:0 "We won't upset the Germans."

gerfor.140.t:0 "Germany Proposes Research Treaty"

Kaiser Wilhelm II explained the reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France in a special radio address, and called for eradication of final obstacle to achieving "A Place in the Sun".

Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the War Secretary was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While General von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughters' doings, the real question for von Schleicher is - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - replace him with whom?"

On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten the ensuing military dictatorship that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924.

While the Reich enjoyed prosperity under Tirpitz's reign, he also continued to hold off on fulfilling the Kaiser's Easter Promises made in 1917, leaving us with political tensions brewing in recent years.\n\nStill, his prestige is enormous, and the anniversary of his death has been accompanied by public demonstrations of respect all over the Empire."

'Unser Kampf' boasts the highest production values hitherto seen - made possible by state investments into the Babelsberg studios - and offers a frighteningly real depiction of the war. Starring Heinz Ruhmann, Hans Albers and Theodor Loos, the story focuses on the heroism and dedication of the 'small people' in the Weltkrieg, such as the valiant corporal Adolf Hitler, who sacrificed everything for his Kaiser and the Reich."

germit.6.a:0 "A sound proposal."

germit.7.t:0 "Europakommission Membership"
germit.7.d:0 "Though Mitteleuropa nations share a common currency in the form of the Europamark, to be a proper part of the bloc now, a nation must put itself under the jurisdiction of the Europakommission.

germit.12.d:0 "As a result of our membership of Mitteleuropa we became incredibly integrated into the bloc, taking on a number of obligations while also receiving some benefits such as in trade and mutual defence. Unfortunately the time has now come to try to disentangle these tendrils from our state, something that is easier said than done."

gerdom.269.t:0 "The Cretan Question"
gerdom.269.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our colonial empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete. Crete is larger and harder to defend than Malta, and the upkeep is higher as well. To help with our deficit, it has been proposed that we essentially sell the island to either the Ottomans or the Greeks. What shall we do?"
gerdom.269.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence."
gerdom.269.b:0 "Offer Crete to the Ottomans."
gerdom.269.c:0 "Offer Crete to the Greeks."

gerdom.270.t:0 "Sale of Crete"
gerdom.270.d:0 "The Germans have come offering the sale of Crete. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Mediterranean. What shall our reply be?"
gerdom.270.a:0 "Welcome home, Crete!"
gerdom.270.b:0 "We do not need that rock."

gerdom.271.t:0 "Sale of Crete"
gerdom.271.d:0 "The Ottoman Ambassador has sent a message to us, declaring that the Sultan has agreed to buy Crete. We have begun to transfer control of the Cretan State to them."
gerdom.271.a:0 "Great."

gerdom.272.t:0 "Ottomans Refuse Crete Offer"
gerdom.272.d:0 "The Ottomans have replied to our offer, flatly stating that they do not want Crete. What shall we do?"
gerdom.272.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence then."
gerdom.272.b:0 "Offer it to Greece."

gerdom.273.t:0 "Sale of Crete"
gerdom.273.d:0 "The Germans have come offering the sale of Crete. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Mediterranean. What shall our reply be?"
gerdom.273.a:0 "Welcome home, Crete."
gerdom.273.b:0 "We do not need that rock."

gerdom.275.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence then."
gerdom.275.b:0 "Offer it to the Ottoman Empire."

gerdom.276.t:0 "The Cretan State"
gerdom.276.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As the Cretan State was originally created because of our weak grasp on the island, the majority of the ministers are pushing to just merely shuffle the administration around in Crete. However a few hawkish men are calling for direct annexation. What shall we do?"
gerdom.276.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
gerdom.276.b:0 "End its autonomy!"

gerdom.277.t:0 "The Cretan State"
gerdom.277.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As Crete was ours before we lost the Weltkrieg, the majority of the ministers are pushing to annex the Cretan state. However, a few outspoken figures are calling for only an indirect subordination of Crete, due in part to lingering prejudice against Cretans. What shall we do?"
gerdom.277.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
gerdom.277.b:0 "Hurrah for the second Enosis!"

gerdom.278.t:0 "The Second Weltkrieg!"
gerdom.278.d:0 "The Germans and French are once more at war! While we have duly joined the war against the Syndicalists, the 'Enosis' brotherhood have been gathering strength..."
gerdom.278.a:0 "The Enosis brotherhood launches a coup against the government!"

gerdom.284.t:0 "Status of Crete"
gerdom.284.d:0 "Due to the Kaiserbund policy we have made cutting down the administrative costs of our colonies, one of which is the island of Crete in the Aegean Sea. The island has had a turbulent history, and many foreign groups are interested in it, we may be able to defend the island better under local leadership, then again, another 'unsinkable aircraft carrier' wouldn't go amiss."
gerdom.284.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
gerdom.284.b:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

ostraum.2000.t:0 "White Ruthenia asks for increased Self-Governance"
ostraum.2000.d:0 "A communiqué from the government of the Ruthenian King Waldemar I von Hohenzollern has requested more autonomy in their economic policy. They justify this both by claiming it will easen the burden of their still growing economy on the recovering German one, and that it will make their own, shaky government appear more legitimate."
ostraum.2000.a:0 "Dire times afford sacrifices."
ostraum.2000.b:0 "In no way, shape or form shall such a thing occur."

ostraum.2001.t:0 "Germany grants us limited Autonomy"
ostraum.2001.d:0 "The German Government has allowed us self-determination in all things economic."
ostraum.2001.a:0 "Towards a better White Ruthenia."

ostraum.2002.t:0 "Germany has denied our Request."
ostraum.2002.d:0 "The German Government has declined to easen the grip on our economy. In countrary, they seem to be planning to strengthen it."
ostraum.2002.a:0 "We will have our independence in time."
